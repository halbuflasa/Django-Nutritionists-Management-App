# Django Nutritionists Management System Project

## Project Description

The Django Nutritionists Management System is a health management platform designed specifically for nutritionists. It provides a streamlined process for managing patient profiles, meal plans, and dishes while maintaining role-based authorization. The system allows admins to manage users and nutritionists to create tailored meal plans for patients, auto-generate menus from a main template, and manage dishes with detailed nutritional and allergen information.

This application aims to simplify the workflow for nutritionists, enabling efficient and accurate meal planning.
